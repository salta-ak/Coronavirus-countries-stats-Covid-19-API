# API is for:
Data scientists, statisticians, developers, machines, programs, and other websites to be able to quickly fetch up to date culculated rates on the COVID-19 epidemic in specific country and region.  This dynamically generated REST API with Flask and Python returns agregated and culculated monthly rates on spesific country and region based on live cases, vaccination, historical data. This can be used to build tools and systems that are used for advanced rates/ratios analysis and for countries/regions  ranking building in public dashboards and charts.
